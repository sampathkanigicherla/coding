Read on to discover what computer code is and why it is important in today’s society.

What Coding Is
Coding computers means programming them. Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is the process of how we communicate with computers.

Our cell phones, laptops, and tablets need code to work. Coding helps us communicate with our devices. Without coding, smart TVs and traffic lights wouldn’t operate. We wouldn’t be able to find our favorite podcasts or stream a movie on television. Why? Because they all run on code.

Read on to find out how coding works and how we use it in today’s technology.

How Coding Works
Computer programmers use code to tell technology what to do. Computers, for example, don’t understand words. They read computer code rather than human language. Programming languages help computers and other devices understand commands and concepts. Coding functions like a manual. Computers read it and follow a step-by-step guide on how to function.

Each computer application needs a written code to know what to do. Computer software and programs have thousands to billions of lines of coded text and numbers. Computers must speed read the code to execute online and offline tasks.

In today’s digital world, everything runs on code. We see it in:

Household appliances
Personal computers
Smart TVs
Software programs
Vehicles
Web applications
When you tell a computer to upload an image on the screen, it takes code. Displaying images and text, changing font sizes, and opening your email all require computer coding. But when you perform these tasks, it isn’t code that shows up on the screen. You see only the words and images computer programmers asked a computer to display.

Remember, coding tells a machine what to do. Programming languages provide the rules and structure that a computer will follow. They give functions that a computer must carry out. We discuss some of the most popular programming languages below. But each programming language helps us communicate with computers and machines.

Is Learning to Code Difficult?
What’s coding? Coding is a skill. Developing a skill takes time. But if you are a tech-savvy person and enjoy working with computers, coding computers can be rewarding.

Coding demands critical thinking skills. You should also be creative. Being persistent pays off in coding. The easiest coding languages involve a few hundred terms and rules to remember. Once you learn the basics, it’s easy to learn other ways to code. You start by learning a simple binary code, and from there you learn more complex coding practices.

Many programming languages use similar methods to code and debug computer applications. The skills you learn to code in the beginning help lay the foundation for developing advanced techniques. But there are certain skills every coder needs.

Attention to detail
Computer programming coding requires strong attention to detail. When you write computer code, you pour over long lines of coded text. You inspect binary code and look for errors. Having the ability to pay attention to details helps.

Problem-solving skills
Sure, even good coders get frustrated. But the best don’t let frustration win. They use their problem-solving skills to persist against challenges.

Technology skills
Computer and technology skills are important if you want to work as a computer programmer. But you can learn programming languages. Most technology skills develop with experience.

Reasoning skills
Logic and reasoning are important skills and abilities to have as a coder. They help coders conclude what’s not working right. They also help coders discover errors and fix problems when writing code.

Writing skills
While computer language is different than human language, it helps to be proficient in both. Good writing skills are necessary to create code that conveys a clear, concise, and intended message.

Popular Coding Languages to Learn
Since the 1970s, computer experts have created more than 700 different programming languages. Each programming language has a unique way of helping computers process large amounts of information. Every coding language has different features and terms, but many overlap.

New coders shouldn’t get overwhelmed by the many computer programming languages. There are only a dozen that coders use on a routine basis. These include Ruby, Swift, JavaScript, and more.

Let’s look at some of the major coding languages beginners should know.

HTML
HTML, or hypertext markup language, is the standard way of coding web pages to showcase electronic information. Founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML helps to format content, pictures, and videos featured online. HTML tells the internet browser how to display websites for an optimal user experience.

Java
Java is an object-oriented coding language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java has English-based commands used to create applications for a single computer or whole server and tiny applets for websites. Java is a popular favorite for programming mobile apps and video games, such as on Android operating systems.

Python
Python is a server-side web and software development language started by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python has a simple, English-like syntax to script back-end actions for applications, user interfaces, and operating systems. Many platforms, including Google, use Python. It is a popular programming language.

CSS
CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a coding language used to specify a website’s style. Developed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994, CSS informs internet browsers about a page’s layout, background color, font size, cursor shape, and more. Crafting and maintaining solid CSS code is crucial for websites to have aesthetic appeal.

C Language
C Language is a simple coding type initiated in 1972 by Bell Labs to build the UNIX system. Perhaps the easiest programming language, C has 32 basic keywords used for scripting:

Artificial intelligence
Embedded systems
Network drivers
C programming language gets computer hardware communicating.

C++
C++ is another object oriented programming language that expands on C to execute higher-level computer tasks. Released in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ organizes and stores info in bundles for more complex programs. Adobe, Microsoft Office, Amazon, and Mozilla software utilize C++ for fast processing.

PHP
PHP, or hypertext processor, is a coding language for web development founded in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. You use PHP for server scripting with HTML to piece together dynamic website content. WordPress, an open-source online platform that accounts for 20 percent of websites and blogs, uses PHP.

SQL
SQL, or structured query language, is a domain-specific coding type that streams information into a database. First introduced by IBM researchers in 1974, SQL has simple syntax to run back-end web databases. Businesses use SQL to load, retrieve, and analyze text or numbers in their servers.

Other High Level Programming Languages
Perl: Used in network programming and web development.
Ruby on Rails: Used for developing websites and performing data analysis.
Scala: Used for data engineering and data processing.
Visual Basic: Allows programmers to modify code by dragging and dropping objects. You can use it to define behavior and appearance.
